I am Software Engineer. Starting November 2021, I started a Growth Hacker in Start-up Company as a Business Strategy and Management Team Leader.

I'm currently studying Front-end Web development and Data Science and working in Kaggle. I'll chase any opportunity to improve collaboration and outreach in the tech. industry.

My main areas of interest are in ML/DL research, Web development, and Computational Physics.
